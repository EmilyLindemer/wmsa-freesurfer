# wmsa-freesurfer


The code in this repository comprises a package intended for the automatic segmentation of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) in human brain MRI images. Pre-processing of data with FreeSurfer is required for the use of this tool. This tool is currently based in MatLab but future work will pursue translation into Python.
